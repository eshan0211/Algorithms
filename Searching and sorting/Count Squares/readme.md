### Consider a sample space S consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on. You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(N))
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Example 1:

Input :
N = 9
Output:
2
Explanation:
1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares
less than 9. So, the Output is 2.
Example 2:

## Example 1:

Input :
N = 3
Output:
1
Explanation:
1 is the only Perfect Square
less than 3. So, the Output is 1.
