### Given a sorted array arr containing n elements with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.

`Example:
Input:
n=9, x=5
arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125 }
Output:  2 5
Explanation: First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and 
             Last occurrence of 5 is at index 5. `
             
Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
