### Given three distinct numbers A, B and C. Find the number with value in middle (Try to do it with minimum comparisons).

### Expected Time Complexity: `O(1)`
### Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

## Example 1:

Input:
A = 978, B = 518, C = 300
Output:
518
Explanation:
Since 518>300 and 518<978, so 
518 is the middle element.

## Example 2:

Input:
A = 162, B = 934, C = 200
Output:
200
Exaplanation:
Since 200>162 && 200<934,
So, 200 is the middle element.
