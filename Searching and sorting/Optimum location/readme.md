### Optimum location of point to minimize total distance
## Given a set of points as and a line as ax+by+c = 0. We need to find a point on given line for which sum of distances from given set of points is minimum. 



## Example 1:

`In above figure optimum location of point of x - y - 3 = 0 line 
is (2, -1), whose total distance with other points is 20.77, 
which is minimum obtainable total distance.`
